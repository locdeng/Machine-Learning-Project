The Practice of Machine Learning


Datasets
 Task 1: Supervised Learning
- Image dataset of 96×96 size (number of classes: 50).
- We provide 30,000 images (each class has 600 images) as a labeled training set 
and 2500 for a validation set.
- We do not provide the test set, which will be used to evaluate student’s 
submissions by TA.
 Task 2: Semi-Supervised Learning
- Image dataset of 96×96 size (number of classes: 10).
- We provide 6,000 images (each class has 600 images) as labeled training datasets, 
6,000 images as unlabeled training sets, and 500 for validation sets.
 Since we do not provide the test sets, you can evaluate your learned models using the 
provided validation sets (but do NOT use the validation samples to learn your models).
